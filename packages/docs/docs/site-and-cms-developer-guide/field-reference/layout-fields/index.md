# Layout Fields

Layout fields are used to organize and structure forms visually. Unlike data fields and container fields, layout fields do not store values in the content file—they exist purely for presentation and user experience.

## Available Layout Fields

### [Info](./info.md)
Display informational content using markdown formatting with multiple theme options. Perfect for instructions, warnings, or contextual help.

### [Empty Line](./empty-line.md)
Add vertical spacing between form fields to improve visual organization and readability.

### [Bundle Image Thumbnail](./bundle-image-thumbnail.md)
Display thumbnail images within bundle managers for visual content identification.

## Key Characteristics

**No Output Generation:**
Layout fields do not generate any output in your content files. They only affect how the form is displayed to content editors.

**Visual Organization:**
These fields help create intuitive, well-structured forms that guide content editors through the editing process.

**Contextual Help:**
The info field is particularly useful for providing inline documentation, warnings, or examples directly in the form interface.

## When to Use Layout Fields

- **Complex Forms:** Break up long forms with empty lines or informational sections
- **Instructions:** Provide context-specific guidance using info boxes
- **Visual Identification:** Use thumbnails in bundle managers for quick content recognition
- **User Experience:** Improve form usability by grouping related fields and adding visual hierarchy
