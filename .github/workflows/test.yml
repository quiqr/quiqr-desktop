    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment with caching for faster subsequent runs
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '20.x'
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install root dependencies
      # This includes the main package.json dependencies
      - name: Install root dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Install frontend dependencies
      # The frontend is a workspace with its own package.json
      - name: Install frontend dependencies
        working-directory: ./packages/frontend
        run: npm install

      # Step 5: Build workspace packages
      # The frontend depends on @quiqr/types which must be built first
      - name: Build workspace packages
        run: npm run build -w @quiqr/types

      # Step 6: Run frontend tests with coverage
      # This executes all tests in the packages/frontend/test directory
      # Coverage is generated for badge updates on ng branch
      # See: https://vitest.dev/
      - name: Run frontend tests with coverage
        working-directory: ./packages/frontend
        run: npm run test:coverage

      # Step 7: Copy coverage to root for badge action (ng branch only)
      # The badge action expects coverage files in the root directory
      - name: Copy coverage to root
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/ng'
        run: cp -r ./packages/frontend/coverage ./coverage

      # Step 8: Update coverage badge (ng branch only)
      # Requires: gh-pages branch exists and GitHub Pages is enabled
      # Requires: Workflow permissions set to "Read and write permissions"
      # Badge will be hosted at: https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/badges/coverage.svg
      - name: Update Coverage Badge
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/ng'
        uses: we-cli/coverage-badge-action@main

      # Step 9: Run TypeScript type checking
      # Note: Using continue-on-error because there are pre-existing type errors
      # Once all type errors are fixed, remove continue-on-error to make this blocking
      - name: TypeScript type check
        working-directory: ./packages/frontend
        run: npx tsc --noEmit
        continue-on-error: true
