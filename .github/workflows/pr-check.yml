    name: Run Tests and Type Check
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment with caching for faster subsequent runs
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '22.x'
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install root dependencies
      # This includes the main package.json dependencies
      - name: Install root dependencies
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Install frontend dependencies
      # The frontend is a workspace with its own package.json
      - name: Install frontend dependencies
        working-directory: ./packages/frontend
        run: npm ci

      # Step 5: Build workspace packages
      # The frontend depends on @quiqr/types which must be built first
      # The backend tests also require the backend to be built
      - name: Build workspace packages
        run: |
          npm run build -w @quiqr/types
          npm run build -w @quiqr/backend

      # Step 6: Run frontend tests
      # This executes all tests in the packages/frontend/test directory
      # No coverage collection for faster PR feedback
      - name: Run frontend tests
        working-directory: ./packages/frontend
        run: npm run test

      # Step 7: Run backend tests
      # This executes all tests in the packages/backend directory
      # Backend has 260+ tests covering SSG providers, jobs, and utilities
      - name: Run backend tests
        working-directory: ./packages/backend
        run: npm run test

      # Step 8: Run TypeScript type checking
      # Note: Using continue-on-error because there are pre-existing type errors
      # Once all type errors are fixed, remove continue-on-error to make this blocking
      - name: TypeScript type check
        working-directory: ./packages/frontend
        run: npx tsc --noEmit
        continue-on-error: true
